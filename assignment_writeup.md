## Practical Machine Learning: Prediction Assignment Writeup

The wide application of smart devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand and Fitbit makes it possible to 
a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. In this project, the goal will 
be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants, to quantify how well they do it. 
They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.
